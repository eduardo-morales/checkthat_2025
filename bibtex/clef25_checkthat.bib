abstract="The CheckThat! lab aims to advance the development of innovative technologies designed to identify and to counteract online disinformation and manipulation efforts across various languages and platforms. The first five editions of the CheckThat! lab focused on the main tasks of the information verification pipeline: check-worthiness, evidence retrieval and pairing, and verification. Since the 2023 edition, the lab has broadened the focus and addressed new problems on auxiliary tasks supporting research and decision-making during the verification process. In the 2025 edition of the lab, we consider tasks at the core of the verification pipeline again as well as auxiliary tasks: Task 1 is on identification of subjectivity (a follow up of the CheckThat! 2024 edition), Task 2 is on claim normalization, Task 3 addresses fact-checking numerical claims, and Task 4 focuses on scientific web discourse processing. These tasks represent challenging classification and retrieval problems at the document and at the span level, including multilingual settings.",
